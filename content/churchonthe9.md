I was a 2016 Summer Reporting Fellow with [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/), a nonprofit civic journalism lab based on the South Side of Chicago. 

With [Adeshina Emmanuel](https://twitter.com/public_ade) and [Latricia Polk](http://chicagoreporter.com/author/latricia-polk/) I reported a series of stories on economic development in Chatham. 

The *Chicago Magazine* article is up [here](http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/August-2016/Chatham-Church-on-the-9/), and the full series can be found [here](https://www.citybureau.org/chatham/).
