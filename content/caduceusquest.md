*Caduceus Quest* is an adventure-RPG from [Game Changer Chicago](https://ci3.uchicago.edu/labs/game-changer-chicago/) that lets its players move between the roles of doctor, epidemiologist, statistician, civil engineer, and more as they investigate a mysterious outbreak in their hometown.

I acted as head writer and sound designer on this project, as well as co-level designer. *Caduceus Quest* is currently in a prototype phase.
