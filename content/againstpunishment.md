**[Against Punishment](https://issuu.com/projectnia/docs/against-punishment__1_)** is a two-part zine by **[Mariame Kaba](https://twitter.com/prisonculture)** for incarcerated people who want to facilitate conversations with others inside around ideas of punishment, safety, and transformation.

I had the honor of doing print design for this zine and getting it into a format that could be mailed to jails and prisons. I brought on [Naimah Thomas](https://naimahthomasart.com/), who has completed an artist residency at Build Coffee, to do the illustrations.
