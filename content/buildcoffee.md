I opened [Build Coffee](https://buildcoffee.org/) with Hannah Nyhart in the summer of 2017, and currently run our bookstore and events roster.

The shop is housed in the [Experimental Station](https://experimentalstation.org/), a non-profit working to build independent cultural infrastructure on the South Side of Chicago. Our neighbors—and frequent collaborators—within the two-story brick building include bike shop/mentoring program [Blackstone Bicycle Works](https://experimentalstation.org/blackstone), the [61st Street Farmers Market](https://experimentalstation.org/market/), and three journalism projects: the [Invisible Institute](https://invisible.institute), [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/), and the [South Side Weekly](https://southsideweekly.com/).

We act as a small venue for performances, workshops, gallery shows, book groups, game nights, and more. We also sell used books, local small press publications, journals, comics, art books, and zines.

More info, including upcoming events, is available on Build's [website](https://buildcoffee.org/)!
