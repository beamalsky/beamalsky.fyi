*We want a mayor who will fight for public education. We want a mayor who will reinvest in black and brown communities on the South and West Sides. We want a mayor who will address our epidemic of gun violence without the brutality of police or prisons. We want a mayor who will let the young people of Chicago lead.*

#chano4mayor is a maybe-serious campaign to get Chance the Rapper to run for Mayor of Chicago in 2019. The website is live [here](http://chanoformayor.com).
