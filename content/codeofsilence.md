The Code of Silence is a long-term investigation from Jamie Kalven of the [Invisible Institute](https://invisible.institute) on police corruption within Chicago public housing, originally published at 20,000 words in [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/series/code-of-silence/).

I did print and map design for a standalone 40-page newsprint magazine edition of Kalven's investigation. It had a run of 40,000, printed by Harry Backlund of the [South Side Weekly](https://southsideweekly.com/), and was distributed at 400 locations across Chicago.
