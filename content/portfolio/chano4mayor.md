I developed #chano4mayor with Jean Cochrane, Kalil Smith-Nuevelle, and Alex Soble.

<i>We want a mayor who will fight for public education. We want a mayor who will reinvest in black and brown communities on the South and West Sides. We want a mayor who will address our epidemic of gun violence without the brutality of police or prisons. We want a mayor who will let the young people of Chicago lead.<i>
