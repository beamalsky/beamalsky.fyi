A battalion of Twitter bots monitoring whether or not the weather is weird

<!--more-->

***

Each tweets daily at 6pm and a weekly recap on Sundays. I made these bots with [Eric Potash](http://k2co3.net) and [Jonah Bloch-Johnson](http://jonah.org/), the two climate scientists behind [istheweatherweird.com](http://istheweatherweird.com). Data is custom compiled from the NOAA Integrated Surface Database and the National Weather Service API.

This project is currently running for four cities.
- [Chicago](https://twitter.com/itww_chicago)
- [New York](https://twitter.com/itww_newyork)
- [Houston](https://twitter.com/itww_houston)
- [Los Angeles](https://twitter.com/itww_losangeles)
