[**The Circuit**](https://thecircuit.cc/) is a collaboration between the **Better Government Association**, **The Chicago Reporter**, **Injustice Watch**, and **DataMade** to investigate and reveal how Cook Countyâ€™s courts work and how they fail.

In my time at DataMade I built an interactive database to let readers explore the 3 million cases and 5.5 million charges in our data set. This visualization is online as [**The Charges**](https://charges.thecircuit.cc/) and we wrote a detailed methodology [here](https://charges.thecircuit.cc/en/methodology/). The entire site, including all charge categories and their descriptions, is available in both English and Spanish.

This project involved original data collection and over a year of work. A full introduction to it lives [here](https://thecircuit.cc/about_en/).

It was thoroughly recognized in the [2020 Peter Lisagor Awards](https://headlineclub.org/2021/05/14/these-are-the-winners-of-the-2020-peter-lisagor-awards/):
