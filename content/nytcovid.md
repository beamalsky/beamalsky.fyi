Beginning in November 2020, I joined the New York Times Interactives Team as a developer on the Covid-19 tracking project and was part of the data team that won the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.

This project is ongoing and well outlined by this Times Insider article: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/insider/covid-tracking-data.html
